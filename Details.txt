  maps the helpfull cmds with a script name

  help in running the essential cmds for the npm project

**We cannot use external modules directly in html js / browserjs**

Multi Page App:
  https://retail.onlinesbi.sbi/personal/
  A multiple refresh everytime to download common html codes/assets during interaction.
  which leads lots of request and data consumtption and not being smooth

  multiple versions of the html codes for every reload

Single Page Application:
  SPA, loads only the specific contents which needs changes and makes requests/assets calls only for the specific region of the site

  single html code loaded once, whose DOM gets modified on interaction using js

React Setup:

  what is react?
    front-end js library for manipulating DOM and producing contents using jsx
  
  vite --> framework which support npm project creation for libraries like react, preact, vue.js

  1. npm create vite@latest
  2. enter project name
  3. select framework react
  4. select variant javascript
  5. Follow the instructions on the screen
    1. cd <project-name>
    2. npm install
    3. npm run dev
  
  devDependencies -> packages used only during development

  but not when the application goes live to production

    normal import/export using curly braces/ * as utils

  Virtual DOM:
    Real DOM: Tree like structure 
      html 
        head
          title
          script
          icon
        body
          div
          h1
          a
          p

    Virtual DOM: is In Memory Copy of the real DOM used while manipulating the DOM.

    React  SPA:
    Virtual DOM
      The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.

    Advantage: reconciliation process

      where the changes happens only in the virtual DOM which will be compared with old virtual DOM. And if any difference is found it will affected in the Real DOM. 

      No changes, Only memory/Virtual DOM changes not the real DOM
    
  jsx --> javascript xml, which permitts to write html elements inside js file

  Expressions/variables are put inside curly braces of jsx syntax

  className instead of class ( class is a keyword in js )
    class is a keyword for creating blueprints of user defined object
    because of which we need to use className instead of class jsx syntax

    htmlFor instead for in label tag
  
  webpack & babeljs conversion

    bundler -> webpack

    transpiler ( translator + compiler ) -> babel

  Netlify Deployment:

    Making react app available to Public
  
  normal css


Task:

  Price Card Design - https://docs.google.com/document/d/11URBvZUsXT4Sr3YtCuv-5gcOHmkOmX976h-QKcXbWqs/edit

  Complete with component structure, please try the normal react learnt

  Try if You know component way, else wait till next session will teach  the component & props way

Next Session:
  module css
  Component & Props
  components:
    Simple function returning JSX syntax combined to form a single component
      Eg:
        Card, Instagram Post, Menu Options
     can be used like a tag/element in jsx syntax
    
    props:
      attributes passed for a component is called as prop
      which can be used inside the props / destructured at component level
